# TMOLI
Group 42 Planning and Decision Making project repository. 

# Prerequisites
We recommend that you run this project in a Python virtual environment
 - Python 3
 - numpy
 - pygame
 - MatPlotLib
 - OpEn (pip install opengen) 

# Instructions
To compile the solver, run the file opengen/solver.py. This will create the solver in a my_optimizers directory. To run the file, either run a individual sample run be running the opengen/interface.py file or one of the test cases beginning with test*.py. Running the test cases will also recompile the solver, though this is not necessary.

To enable or disable the "in-front" penalty, uncomment lines 24 and 25 in solver.py
